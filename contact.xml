    <p>
      If you want to write a longer comment, send patches or 
      thing, the best way is probably by using the pingus-
      mailing lists, subscribe information can be found below, to 
      send a mail to the list write to <
	href="mailto:pingus-devel@nongnu.org?subject:[non-member]">pingus-devel@nongnu.org</a>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/pingus-devel">pingus-devel</a>
	- Pingus Developer List (for general discussion about the game, the development, etc.).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is currently no pingus-users mailing list due to the 
      of traffic, so using the pingus-devel list for questions about 
      game is perfectly ok.</p>

  <section title="Bug Reports">
    <p>
      If you want to submit a bug report about Pingus or simply 
      the list of open bugs, you can do so 
      the <a href="https://github.com/Pingus/pingus/issues">
      Issue Tracker</a>. Submitting stuff there should make it 
      that it doesn't get lost.

  <section title="IRC">
    <p>For a quick help you can try the IRC server <
      class="irc">irc.freenode.net:6667</tt> and the channel <
      class="irc">#pingus</tt>, you can find the project 
      (nick: grumbel) there most of the time. From time to time 
      will also be IRC Meetings with larger parts of the 
      team, once such meetings happen, they will get announced in 
      news section.
