        <question>Is there a Windows version?</question>
        <answer>
          An official Windows version of 0.6.0 was never created and
          probably never will be. There is however some hope that a
          Windows version will follow for the next release. If you
          search the mailing list archives you might also be able to
          find some unofficial build for Windows.

      <faq date="14 Jan 2007">
        <question>Where can I find more levels?</question>
        <answer>
          <em>Foreword: Every level that isn't reachable via the GUI in Pingus
          is unsupported and might be completely broken. If you want to try
          them you are on your own.</em> <br /><br />

          Besides the 22 tested and cleaned up levels of the first island that
          come with Pingus. There are also around 120 levels that might be
          playable and another 100 levels that are incomplete at the moment.
          These levels can be found in the <tt>data/levels/playable</tt> and
          <tt>data/levels/wip/</tt> (wip = work in progress). The levels in the
          <tt>playable/</tt> directory might be playable, but there is no
          guarantee for that. They haven't been tested. They might be broken
          due to engine changes.  They might be far too easy or far too hard or
          simply incomplete. The <tt>wip/</tt> directory contains levels that
          are not playable at all. Some of them might even lack entrances
          and/or exits. Don't be surprised that you can't play them. Instead,
          these levels  can be used as framework for levels you want to create
          yourself with the level editor.  Yes, you heard it right, Pingus
          comes with a fully working level editor. It might not be 100% bug
          free, but it was used to construct all the levels that you see in the
          game, so don't hesitate to try it out and build your own levels.

        <question>I tried compiling it, but something didn't work!</question>
        <answer>
          Technically, this isn't a question. You have to be more specific. A
          general suggestion is to search the <a
          href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=pingus">Bug Tracker</a>
          for similar problems.

        <question>
          Why is Pingus still not done after being in development for so many years?
        </question>
        <answer>
          Because <em>you</em> didn't contribute! Joking asside, most
          of the developers involved with Pingus are also involved
          with a heap load of other projects, so it takes time to find
          time to develop on the game. Help is of course always
          welcome.

      <faq date="14 Jan 2007">
        <question>
          Pingus runs too slow. Is there any way to make it faster?
        </question>

        <answer>
          There are multiple ways to tune the running speed of
          Pingus. <br /> Firstly, reducing the screen colour
          depth (to 16bit, for example) on a slower computer might
          give you a boost of around 50% percent, depending on your
          hardware. X11 doesn't allow switching color depth at run
          time, and the exact instructions for doing this are outside
          of the scope of this FAQ. Consult your distribution
          documentation for more information.<br /><br />

          Secondly, a gain in speed can be achieved by
          reducing the display resolution of Pingus. For example, if
          you want to run Pingus at 640x480 you can do this with the
          following command:<br />

          <tt>pingus -g 640x480</tt><br/><br />

          Thirdly, you can run Pingus in a <em>fast-mode</em>.  This
          mode disables all costly particle effects and the
          background.  Thus, Pingus will look less pretty, but will
          probably be a good amount faster. Fast-mode can be turned on
          with:<br />

          <tt>pingus --fast-mode</tt><br/> Remember, the
          <em>fast-mode</em> has lots of room for improvement. If it
          doesn't help you make Pingus run fast enough, not all is
          lost. <br /><br />

          If that is not enough, you might also want to play
          with the <tt>min-frame-skip</tt> and <tt>max-frame-skip</tt>
          options.  Both should result in a more uniform frame-rate.
          This can make the game jerky, but playability can be
          improved nonetheless.<br /><br />

          Finally, the 'F11' key can help you a great deal in
          your optimisation process by showing the frame-rate counter.
