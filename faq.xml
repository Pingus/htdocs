      <faq date="04 Oct 2010">
        <question>Where can I find more levels?</question>
        <answer>
          <p>
            Besides the 22 tested and cleaned up levels of the first island 
            come with Pingus. There are also around 120 levels that might 
            playable and another 100 levels that are incomplete at the moment.
            These levels can be found in the <tt>data/levels/playable</tt> 
            <tt>data/levels/wip/</tt> (wip = work in progress)
            directories:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><tt>data/levels/playable/</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              The levels in 
              <tt>playable/</tt> directory might be playable, but 
              is no guarantee for that. They might been broken due 
              engine changes, they might be far too easy or far too 
              or simply incomplete.
            </dd>

            <dt><tt>data/levels/wip/</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              The <tt>wip/</tt> directory 
              levels that are not playable at all. Some of them 
              even lack entrances and/or exits. Don't be surprised 
              you can't play them. Instead, these levels can be used 
              starting points for levels you want to create 
              with the level editor.

      <faq date="04 Dec 2010">
        <question>
          How do I start the other levels?
        </question>
        <answer>
	  <p>
            There are two ways to start the levels. The first one is to do it simply via the command line:
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>pingus data/levels/playable/somelevel.pingus</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The other, probably more userfriendly, way is to 
            load them into the level editor and then click the 
            button.

      <faq date="14 Jan 2007">
        <question>
          Pingus runs too slow. Is there any way to make it faster?
        </question>

        <answer>
          <p>
            There are multiple ways to tune the running speed 
            Pingus. <br /> Firstly, reducing the screen 
            depth (to 16bit, for example) on a slower computer 
            give you a boost of around 50% percent, depending on 
            hardware. X11 doesn't allow switching color depth at 
            time, and the exact instructions for doing this are 
            of the scope of this FAQ. Consult your 
            documentation for more information.
          </p>

          <p>Secondly, a gain in speed can be achieved 
            reducing the display resolution of Pingus. For example, 
            you want to run Pingus at 640x480 you can do this with 
            following command:</p>

          <p><code>pingus -g 640x480</code></p>

          <p>Thirdly, you can run Pingus in a <em>fast-mode</em>.  
            mode disables all costly particle effects and 
            background.  Thus, Pingus will look less pretty, but 
            probably be a good amount faster. Fast-mode can be turned 
            with:</p>

          <p><code>pingus --fast-mode</code></p>
          
          <p>Remember, the <em>fast-mode</em> has lots of room 
            improvement. If it doesn't help you make Pingus run 
            enough, not all is lost.</p>
          
          <p>If that is not enough, you might also want to 
            with the <tt>min-frame-skip</tt> and <tt>max-frame-skip</tt>
            options.  Both should result in a more uniform frame-rate.
            This can make the game jerky, but playability can 
            improved nonetheless.</p>

          <p>Finally, the 'F11' key can help you a great deal 
            your optimisation process by showing the frame-rate counter.</p>
