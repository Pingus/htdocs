    <p>
    All information concerning the development and beta testing 
    Pingus is at a separate section on this webpage (which 
    currently out of order), so that players don't accidentally 
    stuff that wasn't yet meant for release or grab a 
    snapshot, instead of a stable binary by accident. So if you are 
    player don't enter this section, but instead stay on the 
    site of the Pingus webpage and simply wait for the next 
    release which will contain everything in a nice packaged 
    useable form, going to the development section will just spoil 
    a lot.<br/><br/>

    If you are or want to become a developer you are of course 
    to the dark site of Pingus, there you will find source 
    documentation, a todo with stuff that needs to be done 
    unfinished game elements that might need you to finish them.
