    <p>
    All information concerning the development and beta testing of
    Pingus is at a separate section on this webpage (which is
    currently out of order), so that players don't accidentally see
    stuff that wasn't yet meant for release or grab a development
    snapshot, instead of a stable binary by accident. So if you are a
    player don't enter this section, but instead stay on the light
    site of the Pingus webpage and simply wait for the next stable
    release which will contain everything in a nice packaged and
    useable form, going to the development section will just spoil you
    a lot.<br/><br/>

    If you are or want to become a developer you are of course welcome
    to the dark site of Pingus, there you will find source code
    documentation, a todo with stuff that needs to be done and
    unfinished game elements that might need you to finish them.
