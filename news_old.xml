        Time for some news, current plans for Pingus look like this:
        <ul>
          <li>Jave27 is currently trying to get the latest version in a release ready state</li>

          <li>Grumbel opened a new branch in SVN called pingus-sdl, this
            is supposed to port Pingus to SDL, level file format will
            switch to S-Expr instead of XML
