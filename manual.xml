    <h3>The Faller</h3>

    <p>Once a Pingu is out of the entrance, he will be falling to 
      ground. As a Faller he can't do anything but just obey the law 
      gravity. If the Pingu falls for too long, he will gather too 
      speed and so won't survive on hitting the ground. So be 
      and keep an eye on the height of objects from which they 
      safely fall.
    </p>


    <subsection title="The Walker">
      <p>If the Pingu has fallen from the entrance and safely 
        the ground, the Pingu will turn into a Walker. The Walker is 
        state in which the Pingu will be most of the time. As a Walker 
        Pingu simply moves in the current direction in which he is facing.
        He will walk in this way until you give him a command to 
        something else. However, if the Pingu reaches an obstacle that 
        cannot walk up or through, he will turn around and walk back 
        the opposite direction.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Digger">
      <p>When a Pingu is turned into a Digger, he 
        digging/drilling a vertical hole through any object that 
        would otherwise walk on.  A Digger continues digging a hole 
        there is nothing below it to dig, in which case the Digger 
        fall, or the Digger hits a solid object, such as metal.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Basher">
      <p>A Basher is the horizontal equivalent of a Digger. A 
        bashes out a tunnel through any object that is ahead of it. 
        stops bashing when there is nothing ahead to bash, a solid 
        has been reached, such as metal, or there is nothing below 
        Basher. In the latter case, the Basher will fall.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Miner">
      <p>The Miner can be considered to be a combination of a Digger 
        a Basher. Whereas a Digger only goes down and a Basher only 
        forward, the Miner goes down and forward in one movement. 
        results in a tunnel going diagonally downwards.  Like a Digger 
        a Basher, a Miner stops if there is nothing to mine, a 
        object has been reached or there is nothing below the Miner. 
        the latter case, the Miner will fall.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Blocker">

      <p>The blocker stops at its current position and then starts 
        command other Pingus which reach him to change their direction. 
        Pingu can thus pass a Blocker. Instead they will turn around 
        head in the other direction.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Bomber">
      
      <p>Sometimes when you have to stop a Pingu or have to create 
        hole, but have neither a Basher nor a Miner, there is no way 
        than to turn a Pingu into a Bomber. The Pingu will start 
        countdown once he has turned into a Bomber. He will continue 
        current action until the countdown reaches zero. On zero 
        reached, he will inflate and then explode. The explosion 
        create a hole in the ground and destroy anything that is near him.
        Thus a Bomber can be used to either make holes or to 
        Blockers or other Pingus that are in the way.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Bridger">
      
      <p>A Pingu turned into a Bridger will start to build a 
        bridge. It will not be a large bridge and goes slightly upwards.
        In most cases this will be enough to reach a higher point or 
        pass a deep hole in the ground.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Climber">

      <p>A Pingu that has learned the ability to climb will be able 
        climb on vertical objects which normal Pingus cannot climb. 
        Climber will climb to the top of an object that would 
        block his way. Once at the top, he will turn back into a 
        Walker. A Pingu that has learnt the ability to Climb will 
        keep it, you can see which Pingus can climb and which can't by 
        little <tt>[c]</tt> in the info box that appears if you place 
        cursor on a Pingu.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Floater">

      <p>Like the Climber action, the Floater action will also stay 
        the Pingu once it is applied. This time you can see which 
        can float by the little <tt>[f]</tt> in the info box of the Pingu.
        A Pingu that can Float will use his propeller-hat to reduce 
        falling speed during a fall. Once he has his propeller-hat on, 
        will be slow enough to not die on hitting the ground. So 
        Floater action protects the Pingu from high falls, which a 
        Pingu would not survive.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="The Jumper">

      <p>A Pingu that gets turned into a Jumper will gather all 
        power and start a single large jump forward. He will not jump 
        high, but pretty far and pretty fast. He can thus reach 
        platforms or get past situations in which he can't stay too 
        in one place.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection title="The Slider">
      
      <p>Once you give a Pingu the command to become a Slider, he 
        jump on his belly and move forward with a lot of speed. But 
        careful. To get the speed, the Pingu needs a perfectly 
        stretch of ground. On bumpy terrain, a Pingu cannot slide 
        far. The Slider is at its best if used on icy ground.</p>

    <subsection title="Reverse a Pingu without using Blockers">
      <p>The usual way of stopping a Pingu from walking off a 
        cliff is to use a Blocker. However, suppose there are no 
        available. How can the direction of a Pingu be reversed so that 
        walks in the opposite direction? Here's how it could be done.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Turn the Pingu to be reversed into a Digger.</li>
        <li>Let the Digger dig a little bit.</li>
        <li>Turn the Digger into a Bridger.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The Bridger should eventually stop building while still 
        the hole, reverse and then walk out of the hole in the 
        direction of the bridge.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Releasing a Blocker without killing him">
      <p>To release a Blocker in a non-destructive manner, use a Miner 
        dig away the ground underneath it.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Mine the other way">
      <p>If you have a Builder, a Digger, and a Miner, and you want 
        Pingu to mine down and to the opposite direction of that which it 
        facing, try this trick. Turn it into a Digger momentarily, and 
        it's down four pixels or so, turn it into a Bridger. It will 
        to build its way out of the pit, but then turn around after two or 
        three steps. Now you can have it mine in the opposite direction.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Getting one Pingu out">
      <p>If you have a Blocker holding in your Pingus, and want to get 
        one Pingu past it without blowing it up, build a bridge that would 
        over the Blocker's head.  Then watch the Pingus falling off the end 
        of the bridge. As soon as one falls past the Blocker, make the 
        a Digger. This stops the rest from getting past.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Zig-Zag stairs">
      <p>If some Pingus are stuck in a pit, they can be freed by numerous 
        Bridgers planting stairs in a zig-zag pattern upward. Each Bridger 
        starts building to the left from the top of a right slanted 
        (which has run into a wall), and vice versa.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Path-finder Pingu">
      <p>Use one Pingu to blaze a trail across the screen, and then release 
        the others once the route has been completed. Often the Path-finder is 
        an Athlete (Climber and Floater) but not always. If the screen has 
        several trapdoors then you probably  need one Path-finder per entrance.
        In the latter case it's best to try and deal with each trapdoor 
        separately; trying to handle them all at once and skipping from one 
        another is usually doomed to failure.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Building Steps">
      <p>If a group of Pingus need to fall down from a high structure, 
        you don't have enough Floaters, you can use a Digger Pingu to create 
        step for them.  If the drop is twice as far as the Pingus can fall, 
        thereabouts, Have the Digger tunnel down right at the edge of the cliff,
        and then stop half way. You can stop it by turning it into a Builder.
        Then the Pingus will fall twice, once to the step the Digger made, 
        then to the ground below. If the drop is farther than that, you can 
        multiple Diggers, staggering them Creating a series of steps.</p>
