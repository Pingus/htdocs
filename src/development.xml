    <p>
    All information concerning the development and beta testing of
    Pingus is at a separate section on this webpage, so that players
    don't accidentally see stuff that wasn't yet meant for release or
    grab a development snapshot, instead of a stable binary by
    accident. So if you are a player don't enter this section, but
    instead stay on the light site of the Pingus webpage and simply
    wait for the next stable release which will contain everything in
    a nice packaged and useable form, going to the development section
    will just spoil you a lot.<br/><br/>

    If you are or want to become a developer you are of course welcome
    to the dark site of Pingus, there you will find source code
    documentation, a todo with stuff that needs to be done and
    unfinished game elements that might need you to finish them.
